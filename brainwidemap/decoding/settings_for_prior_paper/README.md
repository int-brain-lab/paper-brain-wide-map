This directory contains the settings files for comparing against the prior paper decoding results.  
Comparison is necessary because the prior paper finds many more significant regions than BWM block decoding.
Through a progression of decoding runs that add/remove settings, we find that the major contribution to this
difference is the first 90 trials and linear regression.
This directory contains the settings files that implement this progression of decoding runs.  
In the progression of runs, single settings are added/removed.  See the four settings files ``*.py`` 
for details.
This directory also contains a text file from Charles Findling that contains settings for the prior paper.
